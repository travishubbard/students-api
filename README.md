# Student API


I love data, but it does no good sitting on a machine collecting lint.

So I create APIs so we can get to it and do fun things.

Here is a very basic API to a Student database, created using Flask.

Yes, there are "better options" than Flask, but who cares?

It's easy and fast, just like me.
